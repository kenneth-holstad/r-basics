assignment symbols - can use either <- or =
but they recommend using <-

example
a <- 1

variables are a type of object that is stored in the workspace. functions are also objects.

Note: it looks like you can't just type 2a to multiply 2 and a, you should go 2*a

ls() function shows the names of objects saved in workspace
you can call a variable by its name or use print(variable_name)
