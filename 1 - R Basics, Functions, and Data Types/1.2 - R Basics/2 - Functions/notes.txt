We already saw the sqrt() and ls() functions
Functions generally will not work without parentheses (it will show the code for the function instead)
Most functions require arguments in the () - often will put variables in here

Access help files for functions with help(function_name) or ?function_name
This will show both required and optional arguments for functions - or you can see this with args()
Note that functions will assume default order, but if you want, you can also assign the variables by name

Help functions also work for arithmetic operators 
help("+") or ?"+"
That will take you to a page with ALL mathematical operators

You can see pre-built test data-sets with data()
Other prebuilts exist like pi and inf

Use good naming of variables for readability
Rules in r - variables must start with a letter and can't contain spaces
Ofc, you should also avoid making variables that match other pre-defined things in R

Other best practices:
Write scripts for reusability
Make comments starting with ##

seq(x,y) makes a list of numbers from x to y

you can use log(x) to calculate log with default base 10
or log(x,y) to define with custom base
or log2(x) to calculate base 2, or log10(x)...
