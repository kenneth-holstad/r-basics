Function class() will show the data type of an object
ex: numeric, function

Important data type is "data frames" which is basically a table
Load data with function data()
Function str() shows structure of an object
Function head() shows the top few rows of a dataframe

Function names() shows the column names
To access variables (columns) in dataframe you use $ (dataframe$columnname)
Note: the order of rows is preserved if you call a column like this

Calling one variable like above will give you a "vector" (1-D dataframe) of results
Function length() does what you'd guess
A vector can have type such as "numeric" or "character" or "logical" (T/F)
You can see list of relational operators (i.e. ==) with ?Comparison

Function table() takes a vector as an input and returns the frequency of each unique element in the vector
Ex: number of states per region: table(murders$region)

dataframe[["columnname"]] also accesses a column,
however if you use [] instead of [[]] it returns a new dataframe rather than accessing the original column

You can use function identical() to validate if two objects are identical

There is another data type called "Factors" which store "categorical" data
You can assign categories and R uses integer mapping in the background to store this data - making it more efficient
They recommend avoiding these, although sometimes they may become necessary for certain statistical models
Function levels() shows the categories there are in a factor
Function nlevels() shows the number of categories in a factor
