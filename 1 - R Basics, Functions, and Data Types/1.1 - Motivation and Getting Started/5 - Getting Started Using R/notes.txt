R is more interactive than programming languages created by software engineers
it's open source and many help/community resources are available

many tools need to be added on to the base version of R via packages
dslabs package is made for this course

once packages are installed, they just need to be loaded into each session using "library" command

To install a package, you use the code install.packages("package_name", dependencies = TRUE).

To load a package, you use the code library(package_name).

If you also want to use a dataset from a package you have loaded, then you use the code data(dataset_name). 
To see the dataset, you can take the additional step of View(dataset_name).
