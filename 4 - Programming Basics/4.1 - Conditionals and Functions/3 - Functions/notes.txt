Functions can be utilized to save operations you perform repeatedly

Simple example of function (note this is redundant as mean() already exists):
avg <- function(x){
  s <- sum(x)
  n <- length(x)
  s/n
}

Variables defined within a function are NOT saved in the workspace

# the general form of a function
my_function <- function(VARIABLE_NAME){
  perform operations on VARIABLE_NAME and calculate VALUE
  VALUE
}

# functions can have multiple arguments as well as default values
avg <- function(x, arithmetic = TRUE){
  n <- length(x)
  ifelse(arithmetic, sum(x)/n, prod(x)^(1/n))
}
