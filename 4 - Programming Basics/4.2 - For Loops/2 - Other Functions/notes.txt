It turns out, for loops aren't actually used much in R,
because there are often more powerful ways to do the same thing

Functions that are usually used instead:
apply()
sapply()
tapply()
mapply()

Other functions:
split()
cut()
quantile()
reduce()
identical()

This course does not go into further detail on these, but they are but a google search away...
See how you can use identical() to validate a math function:
# Define the function
compute_s_n <- function(n){
  x <- 1:n
  sum(x^2)
}

# Define the vector of n
n <- 1:25

# Define the vector to store data
s_n <- vector("numeric", 25)
for(i in n){
  s_n[i] <- compute_s_n(i)
}

# Check that s_n is identical to the formula given in the instructions.
identical(s_n, n*(n+1)*(2*n+1)/6)
