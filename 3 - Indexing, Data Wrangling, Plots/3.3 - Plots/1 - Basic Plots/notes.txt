A strength of R is its flexibility in creating different types of plots,
while still being relatively easy to do so (although it isn't as powerful as more difficult software like D3)

A few types of plots:
plot(x,y) - basic scatterplot
For example you can compare murders by population

hist(x) - histogram ## more on this in future courses
for example you may want to use this to compare rates with hist(murders$rate)

boxplot(y~x, data = murders) - boxplot
For example you can compare rates by regions with boxplot(rate~region, data = murders)

image() - color matrix

An entire course in the Data Science specialization is dedicated to visualization
