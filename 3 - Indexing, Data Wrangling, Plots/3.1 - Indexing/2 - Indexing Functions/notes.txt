Three useful functions: which, match, %in%

which() provides entries of a logical vector that are true
index <- which(murder$state = "California")
although it seems like you would just use match for this particular use case...

match() returns index needed to access matches within the vector
index <- match(c("New York", "Florida", "Texas"), murders$state)

%in% checks if elements of a first vector are in a second vector
x %in% y

# to see if Boston, Dakota, and Washington are states
c("Boston", "Dakota", "Washington") %in% murders$state

example to check for low murder rates:
low <- murder_rate < 1
murders$state[which(low)]

to do a "not in":
!ind %in% murders$state
