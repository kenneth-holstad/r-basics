Logical Operators work with vectors
Ex: Find murder rates smaller than a certain value
murder_rate <- murders$total / murders$population * 100000
index <- murder_rate <= 0.71
murders$state[index]
sum(index) ## calculates number of matches of condition

! NOT
| OR
& AND

So, to match two different conditions at once:
west <- murders$region == 'West"
safe <- murder_rate <= 1

index <- safe & west
