To subset and summarize data, we can use the heights data set
heights <- setDT(heights)

# summarizing in dplyr
s <- heights %>%
  summarize(average = mean(height), standard_deviation = sd(height))

# summarizing in data.table
s <- heights[, .(average = mean(height), standard_deviation = sd(height))]


# subsetting and then summarizing in dplyr
s <- heights %>%
  filter(sex == "Female") %>%
  summarize(average = mean(height), standard_deviation = sd(height))

# subsetting and then summarizing in data.table
s <- heights[sex == "Female", .(average = mean(height), standard_deviation = sd(height))]


you can use the "by" argument to do the equivalent of a group_by()

# grouping then summarizing in data.table
heights[, .(average = mean(height), standard_deviation = sd(height)), by = sex]
