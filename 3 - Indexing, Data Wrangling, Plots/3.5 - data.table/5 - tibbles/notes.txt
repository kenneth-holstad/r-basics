a tbl (called "tibble") is also the default data frame in tidyverse

tbl_df is a special kind of data frame
group_by function outputs a special kind of tbl, the grouped_df

you can think of tbl's as modern version of data frames
the print of a tbl is more readable than that of a data frame

You can convert a data frame to a tibble with as_tibble()

Another difference with tbl's is that any subset you take of a tbl is also a tbl
use the accessor $ if you want to get back something else, like a vector or a character

unlike data frames, tibbles will give a warning if you try to access a column that doesn't exist

tibbles can also contain more complex objects than data frames
data frames must be vectors of numbers, strings, or boolean
tibbles can also contain lists, functions, etc.

you can create a tibble with tibble()
# create a tibble
tibble(id = c(1, 2, 3), func = c(mean, median, sd))

that tbl grouped_df stores which rows are in which groups, used by summarize and other tidyverse functions
however many other R functions are not aware of this
to get around this, you can put those other functions inside a summarize()
