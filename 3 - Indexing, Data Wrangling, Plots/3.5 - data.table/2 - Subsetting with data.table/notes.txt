To do the same thing as filter(), the syntax is quite nice with data.table

Because data.table assumes you are dealing with the table and NOT an object in the workspace:
# subsetting in dplyr
filter(murders, rate <= 0.7)

# subsetting in data.table
murders[rate <= 0.7]

thus you can easily combine filter and select in data.table
# combining filter and select in data.table
murders[rate <= 0.7, .(state, rate)]
