Many dplyr functions require data frames

IF YOU ARE USING R VERSION PRIOR TO 4.0,
by default, data frames convert characters into factors, so you may want to turn this off

Example:

#creating a data frame with stringAsFactors = FALSE
grades <- data.frame(names = c("John", "Juan", "Jean", "Yao"),
                     exam_1 = c(95, 80, 90, 85),
                     exam_2 = c(90, 85, 85, 90),
                     stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

But I have version 4.3 installed so that is no worry... unless I want to make them into factors, of course
