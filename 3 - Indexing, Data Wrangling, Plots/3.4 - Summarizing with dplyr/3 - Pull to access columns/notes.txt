Most dplyr functions, including summarize, return a data frame
This can be tricky if you want to use functions on the result

To access values, you can use the access $
or you can use the pull() function

# using pull to save the number directly
us_murder_rate <- murders %>%
  summarize(rate = sum(total) / sum(population) * 10^5) %>%
  pull(rate)
us_murder_rate
