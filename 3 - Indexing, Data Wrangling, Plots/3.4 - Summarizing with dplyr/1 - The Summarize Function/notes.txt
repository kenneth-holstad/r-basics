Summarizing data is important for data analysis
Examples of summary statistics are mean, median, standard deviation
The data visualization course will go a lot more into this

Better understanding of data can also come from splitting data into groups, then applying summary functions
Two new dplyr verbs: group_by and summarize

It seems that summarize just lets you apply calculations to the data-set in a way that produces easily readable code
It doesn't do much besides letting you pass in values from the data set

Example:
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
murders <- mutate(murders, rate = total / population * 10^5)

# minimum, median, and maximum murder rate for the states in the West region
s <- murders %>%
  filter(region == "West") %>%
  summarize(minimum = min(rate),
            median = median(rate),
            maximum = max(rate))
s

see how you can do a mean calculation adjusted by population, which you can't do with just mean()

# average rate unadjusted by population size
mean(murders$rate)

# average rate adjusted by population size
us_murder_rate <- murders %>%
  summarize(rate = sum(total) / sum(population) * 10^5)
us_murder_rate

Example combining some functions with some summarizing:
library(dplyr)
library(NHANES)
data(NHANES)
## complete this line of code.
ref <- NHANES %>% filter(AgeDecade == " 20-29" & Gender == "female") %>% summarize(average = mean(BPSysAve, na.rm = TRUE), standard_deviation = sd(BPSysAve, na.rm = TRUE))
