group_by() function creates a special type of data frame called a "group data frame"

this will adjust how dplyr functions operate on the object

Conceptually, this creates stacked tables which have the same columns but potentially different numbers of rows

So in this case, the summarize will do the calculation for each group
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
murders <- mutate(murders, rate = total / population * 10^5)

# group by region
murders %>% group_by(region)

# summarize after grouping
murders %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarize(median = median(rate))

This is a very common general way to do data analysis
