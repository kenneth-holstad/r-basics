Quantile function can return data divided into quantiles however you want
For example, to divide into min, median, max:

# minimum, median, and maximum murder rate for the states in the West region using quantile
# note that this returns a vector
murders %>%
  filter(region == "West") %>%
  summarize(range = quantile(rate, c(0, 0.5, 1)))

However, note that this is presented in rows rather than columns
To do it in columns, you need to make it into a data frame

# returning minimum, median, and maximum as a data frame
my_quantile <- function(x){
  r <-  quantile(x, c(0, 0.5, 1))
  data.frame(minimum = r[1], median = r[2], maximum = r[3]) 
}
murders %>% 
  filter(region == "West") %>%
  summarize(my_quantile(rate))

To split into n pieces, you can do it either of these ways:
x <- 1:50

quantile(x,seq(0,1,1/n)
quantile(x,seq(0,1,length.out = n+1)

Examples:
quantile(x,seq(0,1,0.1))
quantile(x,seq(0,1,length.out = 11))
