Function sort() sorts a vector in increasing order
Function order() returns an index which sorts the vector

So to sort states by number of murders, you would want to do this:
index <- order(murders$total)
murders$abb[index]

You can use certain functions to find max/min, ex:
max(murders$total) ## highest number of murders
which.max(murders$total) ## index number of state with max murders
murders$state[which.max(murders$total)] ## find state with max murders

i <- which.min(murders$population)
murders$state[i] ## state with minimum population

Function rank() returns a vector showing the rank of each entry in order

Ranking states by population:
data.frame(name = murders$state, rank = rank(murders$population))

Ordering states by population:
states <- murders$state
ranks <- rank(murders$population)
ind <- order(murders$population)
data.frame(states = states[ind], ranks = ranks[ind])

Note that vectors start at position 1, not 0, in R
