Complex data-sets can usually be broken down in vectors

You can create vectors using the concatenate function c()
If you put characters in those () make sure you use quotes, or else R will look for variables with those names

Note that you can name the elements of a numeric vector and it is still a vector
ex: codes <- c(italy = 380, canada = 124, egypt = 818)
Note in that case you don't need the quotes (but it works with them, too)

You could also assign the names separately as such:
codes <- c(380, 124, 818)
country <- c("italy","canada","egypt")
names(codes) <- country

As saw before seq() is another way to produce a vector
Note that seq() has an optional third argument that specifies step size, defaults to 1
There is another optional argument, length.out, which you can use to specify length of vector
Ex: x <- seq(0, 100, length.out = 5) produces 0, 25, 50, 75, 100

Various ways to access particular selections of a vector (called "Subsetting)
Generally uses [], for example:
codes[2]
codes[c(1,3)]
codes[1:2]
codes["canada"]
codes[c("egypt","italy")]
