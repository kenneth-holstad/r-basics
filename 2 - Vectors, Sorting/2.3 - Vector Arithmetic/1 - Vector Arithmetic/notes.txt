Simple example of vector arithmetic: convert a list of heights in inches to centimeters
heights <- c(69,72,...)
heights*2.54

You can do that for other operators like +,-...

In addition, if you have vectors of the same length you can add/subtract them from each other,
or multiply their values, etc.

So to calculate murder rate:
murder_rate <- murders$total / murders$population * 100000

Ordering states by murder rate:
murders$state[order(murder_rate, decreasing=TRUE)]

Example of more complex math with this:
To calculate 1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^2 + ... + 1/100^2

x < 1:100
sum(1/x^2)
