Simple example of vector arithmetic: convert a list of heights in inches to centimeters
heights <- c(69,72,...)
heights*2.54

You can do that for other operators like +,-...

In addition, if you have vectors of the same length you can add/subtract them from each other,
or multiply their values, etc.

IMPORTANT NOTE: R "recycles" - that is, if you try to operate between two vectors of different lengths, it will NOT throw an error
Instead it will repeat the shorter vector into the larger vector

So to calculate murder rate:
murder_rate <- murders$total / murders$population * 100000

Ordering states by murder rate:
murders$state[order(murder_rate, decreasing=TRUE)]

Example of more complex math with this:
To calculate 1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^2 + ... + 1/100^2

x < 1:100
sum(1/x^2)
